Any time you enter personal information where someone can record it online, you are leaving an identity trail for thieves to follow. Anything from signing up for a newsletter, swiping your credit card at a shop, or submitting an online inquiry for services can leave you vulnerable.
	And Identity Theft doesn't happen all at once. Identity thieves may pick up individual pieces of your data over time and store them or trade them until they've collected enough of your information to be able to use it.
