					<h2>Is Your Identity for Sale? </h2>
					<p>Your identity belongs to you, right? Not necessarily.</p>
				</header>
				<p>There's a host of personal details about you that that make up your identity. Just like any information you want to keep secret, the more people you tell, the less likely that information will remain private. You may not realize it, but once you share any of your private information, especially on the internet, not only is it "out there," but it stays "out there." Indefinitely.</p>
				<p>Some details, like a credit card number or a password, you know to keep locked up for safety, and most websites use encryption to make it harder for people to get these details without your permission.</p>
				<p>Other details, like an account username or a home telephone number, may not seem as threatening when they sit on the internet. But in the wrong hands, a collection of these seemingly innocent details can be used to confirm your identity. And once your identity has been confirmed, it can be stolen and sold to someone who could do you grave financial harm.</p>

					<h2>What is Identity Theft?</h2>
					<p>Identity theft is when your personal details are stolen to obtain credit and identity fraud is when those details are then used to commit fraud. By stealing your identity, criminals are able to exploit your personal  details to make fraudulent purchases or access your bank account and personal finances to take your cash.</p>
					<p>Checking the status of your personal and financial information on a regular basis is critical to preventing the negative financial consequences of this kind of fraud. We give you the tools to check the status of this information to mitigate the ongoing threat of today's frequent hacks and data breaches.</p>

				<h2 class="h2">What is "Dark Web" & "Deep Web"</h2>
				<p>The phrases Dark Web and Deep Web are often used interchangeably; however, they do mean different things.</p>
				<p>The 'Dark Web' is a network of websites and material similar to the regular Internet, but the IP address of the servers that host these websites is hidden. Due to this, it is a haven for criminal activity.</p>
				<p>The 'Deep Web' refers to all the websites and material online that is not indexed by any search engine.  The Deep Web will also host legitimate websites and material that organisations such as banks use to hold, for example, the password information you use to login to your online banking. </p>
